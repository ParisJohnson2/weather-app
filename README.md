# weather-app

This weather application displays the temperature of a location, typed in a search-bar. The
background changes according to the search input. The images in the background are from 
www.unsplash.com and are randomly generated by the city name given. I used an api key 
from openweathermap.org to obtain live details on a cities temperature. Other items displayed 
are humidity, wind and a icon to visually show conditions.
